recursion
-----------
- has base case
- it mostly consider every every aspect of the call stack as per the function call inside the function
- can be oprtized via memoization

backtracking
-------------
- has base and and negative base case also
- it's mostly focused on desired solution while discarding other possible solution
- it uses recursion behind the scene
- can be oprtized via memoization
