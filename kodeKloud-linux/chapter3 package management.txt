================================================== chapter 3 ===============================================

-> mostly all these can be found inside /etc/

--------------------------------------- introduction ----------------------------------------

-> WHY?
	- to deal with the installation and execution of various application/program's dependency easily.
	- provides automation for installation, cofiguration, management and removal of packages.
	- keeps package integrity and authenticity etc.
	- provide querying to manage package.
	- keeps us away from dependency HELL


-> package manager types (popular):
	for ubuntu, linux mint
	--------------------------
	#1. DPKG 	- base package manager for DEBIAN  based distribution
	#2. APT 	- front-end for DPKG Debian based distri.
	#3. APT-GET	- traditional front-end for DPKG Debian based distri. 

	for red hat, centOS, fedora 
	-------------------------------
	#4. RPM 	- based package manager for Red Hat based distribution
	#5. YUM 	- front-end for RPM sys.
	#6. DNF 	- more feature rich for RPM sys


---------------------------------------------- RPM -----------------------------------------

-> RPM can be used by: centOS, Red Hat, Fedora

-> can perform: 
	- installation   :	$ rpm -ivh absolute/path/to/package/pkg_rpm_file
	- uninstallation :
	- upgrade
	- query	  	 : 	$ rpm qa | grep pkg_name
	- verifying

-> each above command start from $ rpm ........

-> Problem: do not manage package dependency own its own so we need a higher level package manager like YUM


---------------------------------------------- YUM ------------------------------------------

-> for RPM based distro

-> can be seen to be working and managing inside /etc directory

-> it'll download a package with all its dependencies

-> can perform: 
	- installation 		: $ yum install pkg_name
	- uninstallation 	: $ yum remove pkg_name
	- update 		: $ yum update pkg_name

-> to use centOS use		: $ ssh centos-lab-name

-> to see repos			: $ yum repolist

-> to find package using command: $ yum provides cmd_name


-------------------------------------------- DPKG ---------------------------------------------

-> like low-level package manager

-> use command like: $ dpkg ............

-> can't manage dependency of the packages


------------------------------------------- APT/ APT-GET ----------------------------------------

-> higher level package manager 

-> apt is overall a better tool than apt-get

-> it'll download a package with all its dependencies

-> apt relies on software repo which can be found inside /etc/apt/sources.list

-> basic commands:
	- installation
	--------------
		- $ apt install pkg_name

		- $ apt update       ( to be run after installing any package, to upgrade package)
	
		- $ apt upgrade      ( to be run after update cmd, to install all available upgrade)

		- $ apt 
	

	- uninstallation
	------------------
		- $ apt remove pkg_name


	- searching a pkg inside the repo
	-----------------------------------
		- $ apt search pkg_name


	- to list all the available pkg
	----------------------------------
		- $ apt list | grep pkg_name
