-------------------------------------- archival ----------------------------------

-> getting file/directory size
	- $ du -sh name
	- $ ls -lh name
	- where s is size, h is human readable

-> tar = tape archive

-> tar is used to archive various files into a single unit called tar ball
	 creating tarball
	-------------------
	- $ tar -cf test.tar file1 file2 file3
		- flags: c is create, f is filename of the tar ball created
		- rest is all the files to be archived

	- $ tar -zcf test.tar file1 file2 file3
		- compressed tarball

	
	viewing tarball
	------------------
	- $ ls -ltr test.tar

	- $ tar -tf test.tar
		- to view the files content inside the tb


	extracting tarball
	-------------------
	- $ tar -xf test.tar
		- to extract the tb


------------------------------------------ compression ------------------------------------------

-> compressing file (3 ways)
   ------------------
	- $ bzip2 file
	- $ gzip file
	- $ xz file
	
	- these compression command will add their own type to the compressed file type

-> uncompressing file
   -------------------
	- $ bunzip2 bzip2CompressedFile
	- $ gunzip gzipCompressedFile
	- $ unxz xzCompressedFile

-> we can also read file without uncompressing them using tools such as
	- zcat, bzcat, xzcat


-------------------------------------------- searching -----------------------------------------

-> $ locate filename

-> $ find / -name filename
	- this will search for the name ie. filename inside directory = /

-> to find the maching word/substring inside file/directory 
	commands
	----------
	- $ grep substring filename

	- $ grep -i substring filename
		- will search for the line containing substring inside filename 
		- flag: -i enables case-insensitiveness
		- flag: -v will search for all the lines inside the file which is not having the substring provided
		- flag: -w will search for the exact word not substring
		- flag: -An will grab n more line below the match
		- flag: -Bn will grab n more line above the match

	- $ grep -r "something to be searched" absolute/path/of/search/directory
		- flag: r means recursive


----------------------------------------------- IO redirection --------------------------------------------

-> streams types:
	#1. standard input stream - the text we write to the screen
	#2. standard output stream - the output on the screen
	#3. standard error stream - error messages

-> cat is cmd to open files while > is stream

-> all the streams can be re-directed to a file also using > and >>
	- > is for overwriting a file content
	- >> is for appending the file content

-> eg: using stream to write in to the file
	- $ echo $ENV_VAR > file.txt
		- will create a file and overwrite it with the output of echo 
	
	- $ echo $ENV_VAR >> file.txt 
		- will create a file(if not created) and append it with the output of echo 

	- $ find / -name filename > /absolute/path/to/redirect

	- same will go for error also , but with 2>

---------------------------------------------- command line pipes -------------------------------------------

- used to chain multiple commands (two or more)

- pipes allows us to STDOUT first cmd as STDIN to the second cmd
	- i.e. cmd1 | cmd2

- eg:
	- $ man sudo | grep version
		- here the manual of sudo will be feed as i/p, on top of that grep is executed

	- $ ls | grep ka
		- it'll output only line maching to the sub-string ka
	
	- $ ls | grep -i ka > file_with_ka.txt
		- it'll store the output to the file produced by the grep (working over ls)
